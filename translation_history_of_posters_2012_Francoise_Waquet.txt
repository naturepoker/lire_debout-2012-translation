Reading while standing.
Posters as reading practice in the scientific world

ABSTRACT
The scientific poster, 'displayed writing' of word and image, is for the first time addressed from the
perspective of modes of reading as proposed by various experts, mostly of the scientific and
technical disciplines, in original formats, which differ from those adopted for the use of most texts.
After a historical reconstruction of the subject, the essay examines the impact of reading while
standing on the development of a printed product with the interweaving of text and image. The
recent emergence of digital posters determines new forms suited to reading on screen and when
sitting.

Renaissance paintings depict Saint Jerome set in a certain canon of scholarly reading: he sits and stands perfectly well.(#1) Engravings throughout the modern era, then photos offer the same public and official representation of scholarly reading. Texts referring to the private sphere reveal other reading practices. The jurist Cujas “studied with his belly against the ground lying on a carpet, his books around him”.(#2) The exegete Richard Simon worked “usually lying on a very thick carpet with a few cushions. He had on the floor beside him a writing desk, some paper and the books he wanted to consult”.(#3) The scholar of Bari Giacinto Gimma had converted his bed into an office-library.(#4)

Researchers read sitting, lying down; they also read standing up. One will think of this fairly usual type of reading that we practice in the library between two archs, taking the book from the shelf and going through a few passages to find out if it is worth a deeper reading: cursive reading, often uncomfortable and yet fundamental because operating a sorting which can have serious consequences. All of these examples refer to reading books. However, there are other documents in the world of knowledge which imply another reading attitude, such as looking at and deciphering a document of a graphic nature placed at a distance: inscriptions and figures drawn on the board, a geographical map hanging on the wall or again, in a symposium, a poster. With this last example, we approach a type of scholarly reading that has hardly caught the attention of historians: reading standing up. (#5)

The poster is a scenario that is all the more interesting in that the reading discipline implied by this “type of exhibited writing”(#6) is not without informing the product itself. At the very least, there is an abundant production of practical texts indicating how to make a good poster, that is to say, a poster which presents in the clearest and most convincing way the results of a research to others. Researchers who will read them not sitting quietly in the calm of their office but standing in the haste, the crowd and the noise. Studying the poster as a practice of standing reading also opens up the agendas of cultural anthropology by analyzing the impact of a particular body technique.(#7)

In order to fully grasp the issues at work, I will begin with a brief history of the poster;

#5 As confirmed to me by Roger Chartier, whom I thank.
#6 This concept is due to Armando Petrucci (Jeux de lettres. Formes et usages de l’inscription en Italie, 11e-20e siècles, Paris, Éditions de l’École des hautes études en sciences sociales, 1993). "By exhibited writing, we mean any type of writing designed to be used in open spaces, or even in closed spaces, so as to allow reading by several people (group or mass) and at a distance from text written on an exposed surface; the necessary condition for it to be grasped is that the writing exhibited be of sufficient size and that it presents in a sufficiently obvious and clear manner the message (words and/or images) which it conveys” ( p.10). While Petrucci is first interested in the arrangement of the writings, the presentation and the enhancement of the messages, here, with the case of the poster, the analysis concerns reading conditions and the formatting of a product as well as their interactions.
#7 Here the reference is to the famous article by Marcel Mauss, Les techniques du corps, published in the “Journal de Psychologie” in 1936 and reprinted in ID., Sociologie et anthropologie, Paris, PUF, 19893, p. 363-86.

this will show how this mode of presentation has established itself in the scientific conferences and how it has become, like the article, a real genre. (#8)

The poster is a printed poster, made up of text and images (photos, graphs, diagrams, etc.) which presents the results of a research. During a symposium, the posters grouped, most often thematically, are exhibited in advance in rooms, halls, corridors, etc.; they are then placed on panels. Researchers can thus see them, begin to discuss them with their author (or their authors) or with a colleague, before going to the public presentation made by their author (or one of their authors) during the session. The discussion between the author and the interested persons as well as between the interested persons themselves can be prolonged at the end of the session. This very general description will be clarified progressively; it already gives an idea of the economy of a format that crosses visual communication and oral, formal and informal communication.

Historical Elements
The history of the poster is one of widespread and rapid success in scientific communication. The "first" posters or very similar products were presented as early as 1967 at the Medical Research Center (Carshalton), a major British research institute. These were “prepared cards” on which researchers compiled results, mostly graphs and tables – in fact, the material that was usually shown through slides; the sheets were placed on panels and the authors stood beside them for a discussion. This type of presentation, born in the field of biochemistry, won through the whole discipline, then in the years 1975 and following, was introduced in the international and national conferences of all life sciences.(#9) Once adopted, the posters were almost never questioned; they largely replaced oral communications. This resulted in a new (international) conference scheme which is, very generally, the following:

#####

#8 The following developments on the history of the poster and its transformation into a genre of knowledge are taken from the article by FRANÇOISE WAQUET, Poster et session-poster. Un genre multimédia dans la communication du savoir, in EAD., Respublica academica. Rituels universitaires et genres du savoir (XVII-XXIe siècles), Paris, PUPS, 2010, p. 197-232, to which I refer for the bibliography. In this article, I am limiting myself to conferences; Posters are also used in higher education both by professors, for example, to give a seminar or present thesis topics to students, and by students to present their work.
#9 However, the scientific world as a whole has not switched to posters. On the one hand, sectors in the hard sciences did not lend themselves to it or were less suitable for it: this is the case of theoretical work. On the other hand, its introduction into the humanities and social sciences was late and limited, and posters there often functioned like communications: the author makes his traditional presentation in front of a poster on which he has placed the graphic elements and iconography of his research.

a very small number of plenary lectures (keynote lectures), oral presentations (invited and proposed communications) and a mass of posters. Thus, at the 20th conference of the International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology (Kyoto, 2006) which brought together 9,000 participants, there were 11 plenary lectures, and of the 5,000 papers accepted, 4,000 were in the form of posters. Mutatis mutandis, this scheme is valid for many scientific conferences of less numerical importance.

The success of the poster in the scientific world can easily be explained: the new format met the expectations of conference organizers, authors of communications and participants. From the 1960s, scientific meetings had to cope with a considerable increase in the number of communications linked to the strong growth of the scientific population. An example will give an idea of the magnitude of the problem facing the organizers: in 1963, at the annual meeting of FASEB, the American Federation of Biological Societies, 3138 papers were presented. While it was not possible for economic and material reasons to increase the duration of the conferences or to rent additional premises, the organizers endeavored to contain the growing mass of papers by selecting them, reducing the time floor granted to each (10 or even 5 minutes instead of the usual 15), or by multiplying the parallel sessions. These solutions not only did not win the support of the participants, but they did not solve the problem, unlike posters. The organizers could place in the same room and the same time slot many more posters than communications, up to ten times more, it has been estimated. No wonder scientific societies promoted the new format to their members, as evidenced by journal articles and newsletters, as well as calls for papers from the years 1975-1985.

The communicators and the audience were also not satisfied with the usual form of presentation: communication with slides. The time allotted to each was limited; it was on average 15 minutes (10~12 for the presentation and 3~5 for the discussion), but sometimes less. It was still reduced because of unfailingly occurring incidents in the projection of the slides. The audience had to put up with long series of presentations, sometimes delivered hastily and rendered unintelligible by foreign accents in a science that was already largely spoken in English. They received a considerable mass of original data – the 10-12 minute presentations were highly concentrated – without having the possibility of assimilating all the substance, let alone of making the slightest verification; as for the slides that accompanied the presentation, they were not always of the best quality. The discussion often lasted less than the 3-5 minutes planned because of the delay that had been taken and it only gave rise to one or two questions which rarely led to a real exchange.


Page.13


When a final discussion was scheduled, it was not always very fruitful. It was sometimes abbreviated for the reason that was previously stated; in large halls, it was not audible to part of the audience; some left the session before the end out of weariness or to go elsewhere. Finally, the increasing number of parallel sessions was an additional source of dissatisfaction.

Many of these flaws could be corrected and the organizers worked to improve the traditional format. But the posters prevailed over what was at the center of the grievances: the scientific exchange. It was generally agreed that the function of the conferences was not only the public presentation of results but also and above all the personal exchange of information. From the beginning, the superiority of posters was obvious on this point. They not only allowed more exchanges, but even better exchanges. The posters were displayed for a while. Participants could go see those that stood out from reading the volumne of abstracts or, along the way, had caught their attention. They could quickly judge their interest. They had more information to form an opinion: in fact, what they saw on the panel was no longer, as in traditional communication, the linear presentation of research accompanied by a parade of slides but the whole research at once. Finally, they did not have to endure a myriad of presentations while waiting for the one that interested them. The authors were also more relaxed: they were no longer pressed for time and they had in front of them less impressive audiences than vast anonymous assemblies. Standing by their posters, they could present all of their research or just one aspect, and tailor their presentation and explanations to their audience. This public, it is true, was limited, sometimes even very small, but it was made up of interested people. The author and the public could still discuss outside the session as much as they wanted in front of the document itself; it was easy to ask questions, both on the subject of the research and on specific points. The author could thus obtain more feedback and the participants more benefit from their exchanges with the author. In addition, participants in front of a poster engaged in a discussion whether the author was present or not. All these interpersonal discussions were also a way to get to know each other, to establish relationships that would lead to other exchanges, even to collaborations.

These multiple advantages explain the success of posters. They largely outweighed the few shortcomings and drawbacks of this new format, especially since these were reduced over time, when posters became commonplace and when new reproduction techniques made it possible to print posters economically and aesthetically.

The only “stigma” that has remained is their status in science communication. The poster was immediately judged as less prestigious than a presentation at the podium in a large room. Poster sessions tended to be largely made up of PhD students, post-docs, early-career researchers, or presenting fringe research. Even if opinion has evolved, the posters are at the low point of an architecture of prestige which has, at its summit, the inaugural conference (keynote lecture). A hierarchical division remains between posters and oral communications; it is more or less effective depending on the disciplines and the nature of the meetings.

The genre of knowledge
As posters became an integral part of conferences, the question quickly arose not of their presence but of their quality. A lot of effort has been made to improve the posters and organize the poster session in the best possible way. They have succeeded in creating a genre in scientific communication, a genre more sophisticated than it seems: it constitutes, in fact, an original form of multimedia culture combining writing, image, speech.

The "first" posters did not contain text (apart from captions) but only figures, graphs, tables, figures, photos. Text was unnecessary as the audience circulated among the panels and asked questions of the authors standing next to their presentation. However, writing appeared very early: thus, photos of posters illustrating the minutes of FASEB meetings from the years 1974-1977, already show a few lines of text, developed legends, perhaps the summary.(#10) In fact, the organization of the poster sessions made the text necessary. The posters had to be perfectly intelligible when they were displayed for several hours, but their author was only present a small part of the time. The text therefore entered the poster, but with such success that the problem then arose of containing it within the right limits. Abundance, perhaps overabundance of texts became a major defect which has not disappeared.

Posters remained modest products for a time, which, by the way, makes their initial success and the enthusiasm they aroused remarkable. They were sheets of paper (handwritten or typed), photos, graphic representations more or less artistically arranged on a panel, directly or indirectly by inserting a large sheet of cardboard serving as a background. Over time, the poster initially made of separate pieces has evolved into a large format poster on which text and images are printed. This product was, at first, the prerogative of rich laboratories;

the spread and falling cost of reproduction techniques have democratized it. The paper poster is now mostly a poster printed in color, and there are some that are true graphic masterpieces. Which is not to say that mediocre products have totally disappeared.(#11)

The poster was built on the basis of practicality. In the early days, when the genre was taking shape, scientific societies gave explanations and instructions in their journals and newsletters, and the organizers of colloquia specified in calls for papers what a poster was, what it had to be. This information was most often based on what had been seen and seemed worthy of recommendation. Very quickly, a specific literature was set up, mainly due to people who had presented posters and who formalized their experience: these are books and articles giving indications, advice, tips and, of course, pointing out, on the basis of examples, the mistakes not to be made.(#12) Imitation and oral transmission were also played: many researchers made posters, especially in the beginning, on the basis of what "pioneers” had done, reproducing “models”, taking up an aspect that had pleased, eliminating another that seemed less successful; in addition, researchers who had seen or made a poster explained to colleagues how to proceed. Subsequently, scientific or educational departments of universities also organized training on the art and the way of making and presenting a poster. Even today, while the genre goes without saying, imitation and personal transmission retain a role in the making of posters, quite simply because in the laboratories the elders initiate the younger ones.

A reading/A document
The composition and material presentation of the poster must meet some basic principles, constantly repeated. The poster must be self-sufficient, that is to say, it must, by itself, convey a clear message. Its intended audience is not so much the small number of colleagues working on the same subject – they will come anyway – as researchers in other sub-specialties of the same field. This public may also include researchers who, belonging to a different field,

#####

#11 Prescriptive literature offers, in a kind of pedagogy by error, a panorama of all the failings that come together; see, for example, PETER J. GOSLING, Scientist’s Guide to Poster Presentations, New York, Kluwer Academic, 1999, chap. 15: Common Poster Design Blunders (with photos).
#12 This production is as numerous as it is repetitive; it is mostly in English, both because science is spoken in English and because it was in the United States that the genre 'invented' in Europe had its real start. In this article, references are given to texts that have seemed important, either because they are often quoted or because they are representative.

are likely to be attracted to an aspect of the research presented as long as the poster is well composed and can be seen quickly. (#13) The poster is a medium that serves a scientific message; an overly artistic poster is no substitute for mediocre research, and it may even be counterproductive. (#14) The poster is not an end in itself; it presents the results of a research in order to provoke a discussion: writing, graphics, orality are linked.

These principles are related to a particular type of reading: standing reading, a reading which, already tiring from a physical point of view, combines with the equally demanding intellectual operation of entering original scientific content. It should be noted from the outset that without reaching the staggering figures of the Kyoto symposium that I mentioned above, international scientific symposia easily bring together hundreds of registrants and that the posters number in the tens or even hundreds. Reading the posters is a completely different practice from reading a document, comfortably seated in peace, with plenty of time at your disposal and the possibility of stopping and resuming reading.

First of all, it means going through numerous documents in a limited time. The posters are only visible for a day, half a day, a few hours, rarely for the entire duration of the colloquium. It is then necessary to read them or rather “scan” them quickly to make a first selection and to discern those which deserve to be seen in more depth. It has been established that “a typical reader approaches a poster, stops, reads, understands and continues – all in 90 seconds or less”.(#15) Seeing posters is walking a lot and, when not walking, trampling on the spot. After a long time spent walking and standing, fatigue sets in; and it plays all the more so as the poster exhibition halls are often crowded and noisy. Finally, attention is very much in demand: the authors compete to attract "visitors" - the poster public is not captive, unlike that of traditional sessions - not only to make their research known but also again to initiate a discussion with interested people who will give him their feedback as well as to bring them to come to the public presentation of the work during the poster session.

These reading conditions play a role in the presentation of information on the poster.

A visual format quickly imposed itself: a banner including the title of the poster and the names of the authors with their affiliation surmounts blocks of text and illustrations presented in vertical columns.(#16) A vertical layout is preferable to a horizontal running across the entire panel, which would cause viewers to bump into each other following long lines when they didn't lose track of the text.

Content should be presented in a clear, logical and easy-to-follow order. This tended to adopt an existing format, that is to say, familiar to researchers and, for that very reason, easy to read quickly. All over the world, scientists write their thesis first, then their articles according to a codified plan which consists of the following sections: introduction, material and methods, results and discussion, hence the acronym IMRED (in English IMRAD). This format also works as a search system that allows the reader to find the information that interests him quickly and reliably, without having to read everything. (#17) It is difficult to say when precisely this format was introduced into the posters, very probably in the 1980s. We can also think that the habit of composing according to this scheme naturally imposed it. A guide dating from 1991 indicated that the format of the poster is that of the article: it should include "a brief introduction, an overview of the materials and methods used, a main section devoted to the results, and your conclusions". (#18) Subsequently, this format is invariably prescribed in the practical literature: “The composition of a poster should follow the (IMRED) Introduction, Methods, Results and Discussion convention which is used for other scientific writing”.(#19 )

The consequence was that posters tended to become miniature displayed articles – their authors often thinking that a mass of text was a guarantee of seriousness without counting their desire to put everything down to the smallest detail. Guides and other prescriptive documents have spoken out against this tendency. They showed that, contrary to what authors thought, a mass of text was not necessary to state the quality of a research, and that such slabs of written words somehow repelled the reader;

the details distracted the attention and prevented from getting to the essentials. More positively, they explained how to adapt the IMRED format to the poster: emphasize the introduction and the conclusion; shorten the materials and methods section; omit details – they will be provided during the poster session discussion or given in a handout placed on a table near the poster or attached to the panel; this document may also contain bibliographical indications. Such a presentation corresponds to the act of reading implied by the poster: on the one hand, while the poster must be "scanned" in a very short time, the introduction and the conclusion are the two essential elements to decide on further reading; on the other hand, the standing public cannot quickly read texts full of details or memorize bibliographical references. This presentation is also dictated by the function of the poster which does not deliver a research in its entirety, but which presents the essentials in such a way as to create a discussion.(#20)

A poster must be balanced between text and images (photos, graphs, diagrams, etc.); it therefore contains proportionally more images than a scientific article. Images serve the process of scientific communication according to the principle: “a picture is worth 1000 words”. (#21) They support, highlight and underline the object of research; they clarify, simplify and summarize data; they provide contextual information and have a mnemonic function. (#22) The place and role of images has been amplified throughout the 20th century in scholarly writing. (#23) However, illustrations of a post should not be those published in an article nor reproduce as is images already published in a printed document. They should be simpler and illustrate a single point concisely. This advice has taken on even more importance as computer programs have made it possible not only to easily create images but also to easily obtain highly sophisticated graphic representations. In a similar vein, authors should also avoid including tables with many rows and columns in their posters; what is an excellent way to present data in a printed article is not for a standing reader. (#24)

Made of text and images, the poster is “a visual presentation”: it obeys “a visual knowledge” or “a visual grammar”.(#25) Practical literature gives techniques and tricks borrowed from communication visual, especially remote viewing. Two basic principles, valid for both text and images, keep coming back: less is more and the bigger the better. Hence the recommendations aimed at avoiding two frequent failings: the poster is overloaded; it is difficult to read. They relate in particular to the right proportion of white spaces to leave, as a kind of "breathing", between the blocks of images and texts, to the choice of characters (size, style, font), to the colors and their effects, by avoiding here a defect that the diffusion of new techniques has favored: swatches; it is also advisable to place the bulk of the information in the area that the eye can easily scan and to avoid placing text in the lower part of the poster.

As a visual product, the poster also requires a different writing from that of the article. The text, reduced to the essential minimum, will be presented in separate statements; the prose will be clear, concise and devoid of all jargon, the style direct; paragraphs will be short, sentences brief; keywords or bullets and numbers will be used to highlight important points. All these instructions – and we cannot follow them in the infinity of details – are intended to ensure a perfect reading of the message and first, let us repeat, its readability. A cluttered, confusing, and poorly read poster does not entice the “visitor” to stop, go to the public presentation during the poster session, or engage in discussion with the author.

Back to seated reading?
The poster is now mostly a paper poster. However, in the early 2000s, a new form of poster appeared: the electronic poster that can be viewed on a screen. It is less costly in terms of time and money (the data is entered in a pre-established electronic format) and it avoids the problems associated with transport and installation; it can offer other forms of information (audiovisual and three-dimensional images) and it allows interactivity. This new product has appeared in the medical methods where imaging has undergone rapid development. I will stick to the example represented by the Radiological Society of North America [RSNA] which experimented with digital posters during its 2004 annual meeting.(#26)

#####

#25 See, for example, on this point J. D. WOOLSEY, Combating, cit., p. 325-32.
#26 The annual meetings of the RSNA are events of major importance in the discipline of radiology; they attract thousands of participants from all over the world: thus, in 2004, there were more than 60,000 registered participants, including 26,000 professionals (researchers, practitioners, etc.). Refer to the company's website (www.rsna.org) by going to the "Annual Meeting" section where you can find the archives of past meetings as well as the Daily Bulletin published every day for the duration of each annual meeting. I would like to thank Dr Olivier Granat for drawing my attention to the digital poster and the initiative taken by the RSNA in this regard.


Page.20


This initiative sparked debate. Some denounced a loss of personal contact and the risk of ending up with a virtual conference. The others pointed to the greater flexibility and creativity of the digital poster, the reduction in costs (in time and money) involved in making a poster, and also a less tiring consultation. (#27) They won. At the 2007 meeting, most of the 607 posters were digital, and there were a thousand screens to view them. Other scientific societies in the medical world have adopted this type of poster, sometimes maintaining the display of paper posters in parallel, but always promoting the possibility of personal contact by organizing discussion sessions or setting up messenger services.

The digital poster can be viewed seated. To take the example of the RSNA, photos in the Daily Bulletin of the meeting show hundreds of screens in front of which are placed chairs, generally two, for the person who visits it and for a contact person – the author of the poster or a colleague. This mode of consultation was considered a significant advantage in comparison with traditional posters. Participants no longer have to stand for hours, walk through huge exhibition halls where a large crowd wanders. The area for viewing electronic posters, although it is vast – let's not forget that it houses a thousand screens – is much calmer if only because there is much less movement: “visitors” sit down in front of a screen, enter their password and can consult all the posters that interest them. The result is, as one satisfaction survey noted, “a more comfortable and less tiring intellectual environment, cutting out the noise and distractions of the paper poster display area.”(#28)

The digital poster is not only read seated, it is read on screen. The reader now stands at a close distance (about 50 cm) and he no longer sees the whole poster at a glance since it is composed of various web pages that scroll vertically. A reflection on this new product was initiated when it was decided to place paper posters on the Internet to maximize their distribution: the change of medium made adaptation necessary. The indications that emerge also apply to posters that are purely digital. If the general principles of simplicity, coherence, readability derived from visual communication remain, modifications are necessary to measure the differences that the new technology entails.

The poster is no longer seen in its entirety but in the parade of web pages that now compose it: the order of presentation must be explicitly indicated in a page presenting the various elements and their relationship or in a navigation map; a reminder of the general title may be required at the top of each web page. The choice of fonts must be determined according to the readability on screen which is not the same as on a printed paper. The use of colors will be limited (no more than four, black and white included) and combinations will be avoided which look bad on screen and cause confusion. The use of characters and colors will be uniform in order to maintain the visual coherence of a document that we only see by pages. Finally, if images and graphics are reduced to fit the average size of a screen, care should be taken to ensure that they remain perfectly legible.(#29)

Digital posters are still the minority. It is not forbidden to think that with the developments of electronic technologies, they acquire a greater share. The researcher will then find the traditional position at the work table: he will read again seated. However, the paper poster reigns today very widely. If the products are not always up to the instructions, recommendations and other advice, the average has greatly progressed, satisfactorily serving the requirements of the scientific world.

This suitability of a product to a type of reading emerges perfectly well from the comparison that can be made when visiting art exhibitions. In addition to the paintings, the photos, the objects to see, there are texts to read, to read standing up, and more, given the success of the public of the exhibitions, in the crowd and the noise. However, the introductory texts to the exhibition and its various sessions are often long and dense, and they are not always written in simple language. The layout of these “exhibited scriptures” doesn’t serve their reading as well as it should, especially when it starts at a dizzying height and ends quite low. The choice of colors for the characters does not facilitate readability and the shiny "ink" in which they are sometimes drawn forces the reader to stand aside to neutralize a reflection that hinders his reading. The cartel specific to each work is often minimalist in the text as well as in the characters and it is readily affixed not at eye level but very low. So many visitors do funny gymnastics, looking at the work, then approaching and bending to decipher the label, finally stepping back to look at the work of which they now know the author and the title.
